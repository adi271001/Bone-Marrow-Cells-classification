# Key Components
## 1. Data Preparation
The code loads medical imaging data for bone marrow cell classification.
It preprocesses the data, including resizing images and preparing training and testing sets.
## 2. Model Architecture
The code defines a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras.
It uses the EfficientNetB5 architecture as a base model, followed by additional layers for classification.
Batch normalization, dropout, and regularization techniques are applied to enhance model performance.
## 3. Training and Callbacks
The model is trained using the training dataset.
A custom callback, MyCallback, is utilized to monitor and adjust the learning rate based on various criteria.
Training progress is logged, including loss, accuracy, learning rate adjustments, and more.
## 4. Visualization and Evaluation
The code includes functions for visualizing training and testing results, such as loss and accuracy over epochs.
Model performance is evaluated on both training and testing datasets.
